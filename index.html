        We all know Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan to 
        be an inseparable pair, but that wasnâ€™t always the case. 
        From the moment these two mismatched monsters met they 
        couldn't stand each other. Monsters University unlocks 
        the door to how Mike and Sulley overcame their differences 
        and became the best of friends.
